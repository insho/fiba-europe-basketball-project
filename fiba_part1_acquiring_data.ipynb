As such, this workbook will focus on ***Fiba Europe***\n",

    "The end result was a collection of about 40,000 matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. While the raw match files contain some metadata like competition name, location of the match and team names, there are NO DATES associated with these matches.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when did they occur, and in what sequence? This is not strictly necessary to create algorythms that rely on in-game information to predict outcomes, but I found it an annoyance and sought some solutions, wich can be found in [Part 3: \"Adding Metadata\"](fiba_part3_finding_additional_metadata.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. There is no clean metadata regarding the age group and sex of the players. Matches include all age groups, from U14 to professional, for both male and female athletes.**\n",

    "I was hoping to split out the algorythms by age and sex, so this too was frustrating. I also sought solutions to this issue. These too can be found in [Part 3: \"Adding Metadata\"](fiba_part3_finding_additional_metadata.ipynb).\n",

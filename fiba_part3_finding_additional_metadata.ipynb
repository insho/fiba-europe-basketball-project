    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As I alluded to in Part 1, one frustrating aspect of the raw play-by-play files is the lack of metadata concerning the date when a match is played, as well as the age and sex of the participants. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt to solve this, I found this archive (hopefully the site still exists):\n",
    "\n",
    "https://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid//sid/9691/_//schedule.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have pages which contain:\n",
    "* leage and competition names\n",
    "* dates of competition!\n",
    "* team names\n",
    "\n",
    "There are \"schedule\" pages, containing tournament schedules and results, and \"boxscore\" pages, with boxscore info of each match\n",
    "\n",
    "screenshots below:\n",
    "\n",
    "schedule:\n",

    "### The Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scrape these pages, compiling a table with competition, team names, dates, etc (as well as a separate table with boxscores)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the team names, competition names and final scores of the games, pair the raw play-by-play matches with their corresponding \"schedule\" and \"boxscore\" pages, if possible. The pairings will not be perfect, as team names are sometimes slightly different from the play-by-play data to the schedule, and certain schedule pages may not be scraped, but with a little logic we should be able to add important metadata to the play-by-play matches"
